The Goal:

To Make a main webpage that links to a bunch of recipes. Each recipe will have an image and a list of ingredients, with instructions for making it. There will be a link back to the main page as well.

Skills to Demonstrate:
- Knowledge of basic html tags, like titles, headers, paragraphs, and lists.
- Setting up links to different pages, including using attributes for directing to a new tab
- Setting up images, including setting width, height, and descriptions for screen readers

What I Learned:
- Html is really annoying to read and edit
- Using the command line for creating and moving files and directories is very useful
- Different sized images can be annoying to setup without making them look stretched or squished
- I understand the importance of having seperated html files for each page
- Dogs in chef hats are fucking cute

What I Didn't End Up Using:
- I didn't make links open in new tabs, since I thought it would be more convenient to just have a link back to the main page instead.
- I'm not sure if there's any standard I should be using when letting the users ctrl click to open a new tab. Maybe I should still be using the norefferer attribute, even though most browsers inheriently use it already?

Final Thoughts:
- Fun little project, if not a little basic. I'm looking forward to styling with css, and adding more functionality to my webpages. On to bigger and more exciting projects I guess.
