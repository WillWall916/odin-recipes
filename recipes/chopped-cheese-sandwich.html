    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is literally the easiest and tastiest sandwich. This NYC-style chopped cheese sandwich is sort of a burger, sort of a sandwich, and 100% mouthwatering and delicious. This sandwich is a classic NY delicacy that originated in bodegas in the Bronx and Harlem.</p>

    <p>The beef is seasoned and cooked perfectly, the creamy American cheese melts onto every chunk of beef, the sauteed onions add the perfect texture and flavor, the crisp lettuce and juicy tomatoes add freshness, and the creamy tangy combination of mayo and ketchup just take the flavors to the next level in the soft, toasted hero roll.</p>
